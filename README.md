Our idea tackles a significant issue that attorneys in Indian courts deal with: the laborious and prone to error manual analysis of unstructured legal case documents.Insufficient contextual knowledge frequently causes delays and imprecise case comprehension. We suggest creating an automated event extraction tool as a solution to this. This program efficiently extracts important events, important players and timelines.
Optimizing case analysis through an intuitive interface, guaranteeing prompt and precise insights.
